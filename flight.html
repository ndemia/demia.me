					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Context</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						As part of the process for a role at a digital marketing agency, they gave me the website of an airline to work on. The task was to create
						a program that would check the flights that the user had previously searched for, and display the last 3 the next time it loaded. The main
						condition was that the code had to work from the console, like it was injected. This assignment relied on another website, and I decided
						to replicate it as a way to practice to improve my initial solution, despite this not being exactly the same.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Requirements</h3>
					<ul class="list list--icons">
						<li class="list__element">To be completed with JavaScript and it had to work from the browser's console.</li>
						<li class="list__element">The results' design should fit in with the rest of the website.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Tech stack</h3>
					<p class="description__text">HTML, CSS (SASS), TypeScript.</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Process</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						First, I had to dig around the website's code to understand its structure. I found out that the website had two forms, one for desktop and
						another one for mobile, and the mobile form was the one that actually processed the form. I also discovered that it used localStorage to
						save previously searched flights. Being a detective can be fun. Design-wise, I made the results blend with the rest of the website, which
						looked nice and was appreciated.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Problems</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						Due to my lack of knowledge at that particular moment in time, I had to hard-code some values, and overall my code was not scalable. It
						still worked though! hehe.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Learnings</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						I'd say I'm much more conscious about making my code scalable by learning and applying best practices. I also don't hard-code values
						anymore. I didn't get the job, but I was still proud of what I had achieved. Now that my skills have improved, I look back at this
						assignment fondly.
