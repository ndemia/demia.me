					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Context</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						As part of the process for a position at a digital marketing agency, they gave me the website of an airline to work on. The task was to
						create a program that would check the flights that the user had previously searched for, and show the last 3 on the website next time it
						loaded.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">
						Because this assignment depended on another website, I decided to replicate it as a way to practice, and to see if I could improve my
						initial solution.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Tech stack</h3>
					<p class="description__text">HTML, CSS (SASS), TypeScript.</p>

					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Process</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						The assignment was meant to be completed with JavaScript and had to work by being run from the browser's console.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">
						I found out that the airline's website used localStorage to save previously searched flights, and design-wise, I made the results blend
						with the rest of the website, which looked nice and was appreciated.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Problems</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						I had to dig deep into the code of the airline's website to understand, and find, the (proper) form and retrieve the values. This was due
						to the fact that there was one form for mobile, and another for non-mobile that worked like a wrapper around former. Being a detective can
						be fun.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Learnings</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						I managed to make it work, but the main issue was that my code was not scalable. And due to lack of knowledge at that time, I had to
						hardcode some values to make it fully work. I didn't get the job, of course, but I was still proud of what I achieved. Now my skills have
						improved, so I look at this test fondly.
