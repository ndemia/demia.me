					<p class="description__text">
						Until now, this assignment has been the most difficult one. It's great to say that I've been able to correct a lot of previous mistakes
						that I've made in the first iteration of this project.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Design</h3>
					<p class="description__text">A design was provided, but I decided to ditch it and make a more fun one instead :)</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Tech stack</h3>
					<p class="description__text">HTML, CSS (SASS), TypeScript.</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Pre-built part</h3>
					<ul class="list list--icons">
						<li class="list__element">There is a web application with a pre-authenticated user.</li>
						<li class="list__element">Each user has an amount of gold coins, which is shown somewhere in the top bar.</li>
						<li class="list__element"
							>There is a stock of items to offer, with a price in gold coins and an available amount. E.g.: 3 swords costing 35 each and 2 helmets
							costing 12 each and so on.
						</li>
						<li class="list__element"
							>For the simplicity of the setup, pre-built storage is in-memory (i.e. some static collections) and the requests to the “back-end” are
							simulated (see service.js).
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Part to be built</h3>
					<ul class="list list--icons">
						<li class="list__element"
							>Make “Buy” button in the top bar show the dialog which will allow user to buy available items (to be displayed in a modal).
						</li>
						<li class="list__element"
							>User can see available items and their price, can type in an amount to buy (integer value), or increment/decrement it with buttons +
							and -. Total cost is calculated in real-time and reflects changes to the amount.
						</li>
						<li class="list__element">If the total cost exceeds available money, message appears and buy button is disabled.</li>
						<li class="list__element"
							>When user clicks 'Buy', dialog is closed, item stocks are updated and user balance is updated. There is no need to store bought items.
						</li>
						<li class="list__element">User can also close the dialog via cancel or close buttons.</li>
						<li class="list__element"
							>Make sure constraints with regard to number of items available and user balance are not violated. Make sure feedback is available to
							users if they cannot accomplish the action (e.g. item is no longer available or a request to the backend fails).
						</li>
						<li class="list__element"
							>A 'random' failure request is implemented for the “Buy” request (e.g. once every 3 requests) and the failure is handled.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<!-- <h3 class="section__title description__title">Process</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
					</p> -->
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Problems</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						The first time I did this project I didn't comprehend that the "database" worked as an API, and replaced it with a Class. It worked, but
						it was not the original intention. For this new iteration, I corrected this mistake, and reverted to the original code. It didn't come
						without its challenges.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">
						The API handled requests for each information individually, which makes sense: you request the user, or you request the stock. Each
						request has a 1 in 3 chances to fail (by design). A lot of the checks during the purchasing process depend on this calls to validate the
						available item quantity. As well as the item's price, specially when calculating total prices. With so many checks, calls, and potential
						failures, the challenge was to keep calls to a minimun. Which I managed to achieve! Once that was done successfully, I just passed that
						information around between the functions or elements that would need it.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Accessibility</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						I learned about the
						<span class="bold">inert</span>
						attribute (and its polyfill), and how to use it to 'disable' parts of the website so that they are not keyboard accessible. In this
						particular case, disabling the 'back' of the website while the modal is open.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">
						I also got familiar with
						<span class="bold">'aria-live'</span>
						and
						<span class="bold">'role'</span>
						attributes so that screen readers can announce changes in the UI. For example, prices updating, alerts and error messages.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">And finally, I got more comfortable with aria-label, aria-hidden, and improving keyboard navigation.</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Learnings</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						TypeScript allowed me to better understand JavaScript. I has also helped me write better, more structered code.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">
						I got more comfortable with promises and asynchronous JavaScript, as well as with handling errors, and managing the flow of information,
						among other things.
