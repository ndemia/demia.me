					<p class="description__text">
						As part of my learning process, and escape tutorial hell, I decided to rebuild all the programming assignments I received over time. This
						one being the most difficult one yet. It's been a great way to recognise, understand, and correct the mistakes I made the first time
						around. And also, just a great opportunity to improve my skills and see my progress.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">
						This assignment came with a pre-built part. The rest was meant to be built following some design guidelines and a set of
						<a class="link link--inline" href="https://github.com/ndemia/marketplace#pre-built-part" target="_blank">
							implementation requirements.

						I kept them, of course, but decided to replace the design with a medieval theme just for fun :)
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Tech stack</h3>
					<p class="description__text">HTML, CSS (SASS), TypeScript.</p>

					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Process</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						The assignment was meant to be completed with JQuery, but since I'm learning JavaScript, I decided to replace it. It worked, but it was
						far from ideal due to my lack of knowledge at the time. It's now been rebuilt using TypeScript.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Problems</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						The first time I did this project I didn't comprehend that the "database" worked as an API, and replaced it with a Class. It worked, but
						it was not the original intention. For this new iteration, I corrected this mistake, and reverted to the original code. It didn't come
						without its challenges.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">
						The API handled requests for each information individually, which makes sense: you request the user, or you request the stock. Each
						request has a 1 in 3 chances to fail (by design). A lot of the checks during the purchasing process depend on this calls to validate the
						available item quantity. As well as the item's price, specially when calculating total prices. With so many checks, calls, and potential
						failures, the challenge was to keep calls to a minimun. Which I managed to achieve! Once that was done successfully, I just passed that
						information around between the functions or elements that would need it.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Accessibility</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						I learned about the
						<span class="bold">inert</span>
						attribute (and its polyfill), and how to use it to 'disable' parts of the website so that they are not keyboard accessible. In this
						particular case, disabling the 'back' of the website while the modal is open.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">
						I also got familiar with
						<span class="bold">'aria-live'</span>
						and
						<span class="bold">'role'</span>
						attributes so that screen readers can announce changes in the UI. For example, prices updating, alerts and error messages.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">And finally, I got more comfortable with aria-label, aria-hidden, and improving keyboard navigation.</p>
					<h3 class="section__title description__title">Learnings</h3>
					<p class="description__text">
						TypeScript allowed me to better understand JavaScript. I has also helped me write better, more structered code.
					</p>
					<p class="description__text">
						I got more comfortable with promises and asynchronous JavaScript, as well as with handling errors, and managing the flow of information,
						among other things.
